<h1>Granite</h1>
<p>Granite (/ˈɡrænɪt/ GRAN-it) is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali
    feldspar, and plagioclase. It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly
    cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous
    intrusions. These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters across to batholiths exposed over hundreds of
    square kilometers.</p>
